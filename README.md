## The idea

Odoo is powerful. AI is powerful. Together they're better.

odoo-mcp-pro connects Claude AI to your Odoo ERP, so you can use natural language as an interface to your business data. Not to replace Odoo's UI -- but to give you a second interface that's faster for many tasks.

> **"Show me all unpaid invoices over 5,000 EUR from Q4"** -- Claude queries your Odoo instance directly and returns the results.

  <img src="docs/demo.gif" alt="Demo of odoo-mcp-pro" width="800"/>
</p>

**Use the interface that fits the task.** Complex configuration? Use the Odoo UI. Quick data lookup, bulk questions, or creating records on the fly? Just ask Claude.

## What you can do

- *"Find all contacts in Amsterdam with open quotations"*
- *"Create a lead for Acme Corp, expected revenue 50k EUR"*
- *"Which sales orders from last month don't have a delivery yet?"*
- *"What fields does the sale.order model have?"*
- *"Update the expected closing date on opportunity #42 to next Friday"*

Works with any Odoo model -- sales, invoices, contacts, inventory, CRM, HR, you name it.

## Get started

### Hosted (recommended)

We run the server for you. No installation, no Docker, no infrastructure.

1. **[Sign up at pantalytics.com](https://pantalytics.com/en/apps/odoo-mcp-server)**
2. Log in and enter your Odoo URL + API key ([how to generate one](SETUP.md#generating-an-odoo-api-key))
3. Add the MCP server to Claude.ai: **Settings > Integrations > Add MCP Server**
4. Start asking questions

Your data stays in Odoo -- the server is a stateless proxy. API keys are encrypted at rest.

### Self-hosted

Deploy on your own infrastructure with Docker Compose, Postgres, Zitadel, and Caddy. Full control, same features.

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the deployment guide.

## How it works

odoo-mcp-pro is an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) -- an open standard that lets AI assistants call external tools. It exposes 6 tools that Claude can call based on your questions:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `search_records` | Search any model with domain filters, sorting, pagination |
| `get_record` | Fetch a specific record by ID with smart field selection |
| `list_models` | Discover available Odoo models |
| `create_record` | Create a new record in any model |
| `update_record` | Update fields on an existing record |
| `delete_record` | Delete a record |

**Supports Odoo 14-19+** -- uses the JSON/2 API for Odoo 19+ and XML-RPC for older versions. The right protocol is selected automatically.

## Security

- **Odoo is the boss.** All data, permissions, and business logic live in Odoo. Each user's API key determines what they can see and do -- ACLs and record rules apply as normal.
- **Stateless proxy.** The MCP server doesn't store or cache your business data.
- **API keys encrypted at rest** using AES-128 (Fernet). Never exposed to Claude, the browser, or logs.
- **You stay in control.** Revoke your API key in Odoo at any time to instantly cut off access.

## Development

```bash
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -q
ruff check . && ruff format .
```
